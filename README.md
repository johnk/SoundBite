# SoundBite

This iOS application provided the ability for users to monitor the status of outbound communications campaigns on the SoundBite
Engage platform. The Engage platform no longer exists, but when it did, it was a SaaS platform for outbound customer communications
via voice, text, and email.

This is an early version of the application that I wrote in Objective C. Later on, I rewrote it in Swift and added more capabilities.
